  condo: "PIs may choose to contribute funding for the purchase of additional hardware, to add capacity or capabilities to the core system.
  The hardware purchase can be tailored to specific research needs (e.g., GPU's, SMP nodes, large memory, solid-state drives, etc.),
  but all equipment must meet a basic level of compatibility with the existing cluster. Contact us to set up a condo."

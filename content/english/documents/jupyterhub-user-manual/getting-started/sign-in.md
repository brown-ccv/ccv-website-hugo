# Before Getting Started

 Prior to accessing Brownâ€™s JupyterHub, you will need the following:

*  A supported web browser \(Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge\)
*  Be enrolled in a course at Brown that utilizes JupyterHub \(ask your professor\)
*  Have read through the [Computing Policies Terms of Service Agreement](../computing-policy.md#brown-jupyterhub-terms-and-service-agreement)

# Sign In

 Start using JupyterHub by signing in to your account.

1.  Go to [https://phys70.jupyter.brown.edu](https://phys70.jupyter.brown.edu/) and click **Sign in with Brown GMail Login**
2.  Enter your Brown email address \(example: john\_doe@brown.edu\) and password

Once authenticated, you should automatically be logged in and a JupyterHub server begin launching. A status bar will appear with detailed information regarding your server startup.

Once connected, you should arrive at the JupyterHub home page as seen below. For more information about the menu buttons and their functionality, see the [Interface Overview](../help-and-support/interface-overview.md) documentation.

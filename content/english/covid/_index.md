        In partnership with the Office of the Vice President for Research, the Center for
        Computation and Visualization is announcing the availability of HPC compute resources
        (condo) for use on the CCV cluster at no-cost for approved research. In addition, we
        will be providing the JHU CSSE COVID-19 dataset with daily updates. Other public
        datasets that are needed may be added on request, if reasonable.

        Please email [support@ccv.brown.edu](mailto:support@ccv.brown.edu) to ask for
        this service and CCV will work with OVPR to vet and approve the request.

        The Center for Computation and Visualization remains committed to supporting
        the computing needs of the Brown Research Community during this difficult time.

        In addition to the various platforms for compute and storage, CCV staff
        will continue to provide data science and consulting support as well as office hours and workshops.
        These will be done remotely, but will continue with the same regularity as was provided on campus.
        Onsite repairs and additions to hardware will be provided as safety permits.

        We are committed to supporting the research community throughout this pandemic.
        Anyone with specific questions or concerns should reach out to Thomas Serre,
        Faculty Director for CCV at thomas_serre@brown.edu, Linnea Wolfe, Operating Director for CCV
        at linnea_wolfe@brown.edu, or Paul Stey, Director of Data Science and Scientific Computing
        at paul_stey@brown.edu.

        Thank you for your patience and continued use of CCV services.

        In partnership with the Office of the Vice President for Research, the Center for
        Computation and Visualization is announcing the availability of HPC compute resources
        (condo) for use on the CCV cluster at no-cost for approved research. In addition, we
        will be providing the JHU CSSE COVID-19 dataset with daily updates. Other public
        datasets that are needed may be added on request, if reasonable.

        Any Brown faculty member whose salary is paid by Brown or whose research is administered
        through Brown is eligible to be a Principal Investigator. Brown faculty employed by 
        affiliated institutions, or Brown faculty whose research is administered through affiliated 
        institutions, may be included as co-PIs on the research team.

        Please email [support@ccv.brown.edu](mailto:support@ccv.brown.edu) to ask for
        this service and CCV will work with OVPR to vet and approve the request.

# Introduction

JupyterHub provides a convenient way to serve Jupyter Notebooks for multiple users with a pre-configured computing environment where users do not need to worry about installing any software packages. This set-up free environment is ideal for courses and workshops with computing components. If you are an instructor, CCV can provide access to a cloud-hosted JupyterHub for your class or workshop. The implementation is supported by Brown CIS, and for any questions/comments/concerns regarding this service, please contact the Brown CIS JupyterHub team by emailing jupyter-help@brown.edu.

## JupyterHub Vs Other Resources for Teaching 

There are other environments that may be great alternatives for your teaching needs. [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) provides a similar Jupyter-based notebook environment that is free to use, and depending on your needs may require not set up at all. It also provides free access to GPU and TPU programming, which can be great for Deep Learning courses. Other new and up-coming platforms such as [https://repl.it](https://repl.it "repl.it") are also great alternatives for teaching and learning programming. To-date JupyterHub provides few benefits over these platforms. We list here few of the differentiating features to help you decide whether JupyterHub is right for your course:

CCV's research software engineers work with researchers to develop scientific software that is essential to conduct their research. This includes, for example, the development of tools and libraries for working with data, building workflows and infrastructure, and web application development. Our team of research software engineers also work with researchers to help take existing software and optimize it for performance and efficiency.

Our research software engineers have expertise in C, C++, Fortran, Python, Julia, JavaScript, Matlab, CUDA, and OpenCL.

Our research software engineers can work with researchers on either a short-term or on a more long-term basisâ€”and anywhere in between. We have existing long-term collaborations with Epidemiology, the Department of Earth, Environment, and Planetary Sciences, and Neuroscience.

In addition to partnering directly with researchers, CCV's team of research software engineers also works to advance best practices in software engineering for scientific software across campus. To that end, we frequently run workshops on best practices in software engineering.

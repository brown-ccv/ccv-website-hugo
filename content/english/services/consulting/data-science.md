The team of data scientists at CCV provide support for Brown researchers who would like help with statistical modeling, machine learning, and writing scientific software.

The breath of methods with which we have expertise is broad—spanning anything from frequentist or Bayesian statistical inference to modern machine learning methods such as deep learning and reinforcement learning. In terms of tools, our data scientists have expertise in Python, R, Julia, C++, and SQL.

Our data scientists can work with researchers on a short-term basis or on a more long-term basis—and anywhere in between. We have existing long-term collaborations with several groups on campus, including the Brown Center for Biomedical Informatics, Brown's COBRE Center for Computational Biology of Human Disease, and several of Brown's administrative offices.

We also have long-running collaborations with researchers in Neuroscience, Sociology, and Engineering.

In addition to directly working with researchers who have data science needs, our group also works to promote robust and reproducible research across the university. To that end, we frequently hold workshops that aim to disseminate the current state-of-the-art tools and best practices for data analysis that is both sound and reproducible.

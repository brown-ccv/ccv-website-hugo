# Condo Model
CCV provides a mechanism for investigators to purchase equipment and add it as a "condo" (condominium). The purchased hardware is not reserved for the exclusive use of the purchaser; rather, it is placed in a general pool of nodes, and the purchaser is given high priority access to 1.25 times the number of purchased cores. For example, a researcher or lab purchasing hardware with 1000 CPU cores would actually receive a condo on Oscar with 1250 CPU cores. 

Note that condo purchases are not limited to CPU-only nodes; GPU nodes can also be included as part of a condo. 

## Job Priority
The high priority guarantees that the purchaser's jobs will run prior to any subscription-based use, unless the purchaser is already using their limit of 1.25 times the number of cores purchased.

CCV standardizes processor, and to an extent, node memory configurations for a period of roughly six months to a year in order to maintain a degree of homogeneity in the cluster. As an example, our current standard node CPU configuration is two-socket Intel Xeon Gold 6242 (16-core, 2.8GHz), with node memory of either 192GB or 384GB.

# Purchasing
Pricing is dependent on the size of the condo, and will be provided upon request. Please contact CCV at [support@ccv.brown.edu](mailto:support@ccv.brown.edu).

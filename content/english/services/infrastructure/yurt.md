---
CCV's state-of-the-art virtual reality theater displays over 100 million stereo pixels and consists of 69 full HD projectors driven by 20 nodes of the CCV HPC cluster. The projectors display onto 145 mirrors covering a 360° surface, including overhead and underfoot. At normal viewing distances, the pixels are smaller than can be resolved by the human retina. The screen consists of translucent polycarbonate. The front wall is 25 feet long and 8 feet high and spans 180° of view. The screens are suspended, along with half of the projectors, from an aluminum superstructure, with a catwalk for maintenance.

The blending and warping that create one image from many projectors is proprietary, from the Scalable Display company, but this library has been licensed to be incorporated into many different applications and software libraries. Many of the applications that run in the YURT use vrg3d, a virtual reality graphics package developed and maintained in the Computer Science department. Other scientific and analysis packages have been successfully incorporated into the YURT, including Blender, a popular open-source 3D modeling game engine, and Paraview, a widely-used scientific graphics and analysis package. These open the YURT to use by a large community or researchers..

We welcome projects that take advantage of this unique technology to advance teaching and research at Brown. Please read below our policies and process to schedule a visit

### Regular Open House

We open the YURT to the public on the last Friday of each month at 10 am. Tours will happen if a minimum of three people have signed up for a visit. We can host at most 8 people and the tour will typically last between 30-60 minutes. If you are interested in visiting the YURT please reserve your spot in our calendar.

* A full demo might take between 15 to 25 minutes.The maximum number of people inside the chamber is 8. Groups over that number need to be divided. Multiply the number of groups by the number of minutes per demo. That will provide an estimate of  the time needed for your tour. We ask to request tours that last at most 60 minutes.
* Be open to reschedule your visit at any time. Many situations out of the CCV staff hands could preclude the good state of the YURT.

Campus File Storage provides university departments, researchers, and individuals with a location on files.brown.edu in which files can be stored. For departments and researchers, these files can be shared with collaborators who have a Brown account.

Your files can be accessed by mapping the drive on your computer (Windows Explorer on PC or Finder on a Mac), or in a web browser (webfiles.brown.edu).  

**Individual Use** - a 100 GB "Home Folder" is created for every faculty, staff, and student at Brown. If you log into a computing lab, the Documents folder is automatically connected to your Home Folder. The storage also integrates with our pilot RemoteApps service, used by Engineering courses and beyond.  

**Departmental Use** - Most departments have a shared drive (also known as "Departmental File Services"). Files can be shared with other members of your department. The quota is based on departmental needs.  

**Research Use** - For research use, our file storage option can accommodate larger allocation for research data that are not primarily used with high performance compute resources.  

**Multimedia Use** - This area is dedicated to storing multimedia assets for the University.

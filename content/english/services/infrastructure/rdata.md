Research Data Storage (RData) is a high-performance storage system built on IBM's GPFS parallel filesytem. It is a tiered system with mutliple internal disk pools of both flash drives and spinning disks.

# Location
Normally RData is your [data directory](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/managing-files/filesystem). 

# Rates
Here are the details of [Rates for Research Data Storage](https://ccv.brown.edu/services/rates/)

# Access
* Users can access their RData by [ssh](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/connecting-to-oscar/ssh) or [VNC](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/connecting-to-oscar/vnc) into Oscar.
* Users can access their RData as a local mount on their computers using either [SMB](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/connecting-to-oscar/cifs) or [CIFS](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/connecting-to-oscar/cifs-non-ad-local-mount)
* Users can access the [snapshops of their RData](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/managing-files/restore) for the last 5-7 days.

# Transfer
* Users can [transfer data between their local computers and Rdata](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/managing-files/filetransfer)
* Users can [transfer data between files.brown.edu and RData](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/managing-files/filetransfer-isilon)

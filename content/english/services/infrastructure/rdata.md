RData is a high-performance storage system built on IBM's GPFS parallel filesytem. It is a tiered system with mutliple internal disk pools of both flash drives and spinning disks. Files stored on RData can be accessed directly from CCV's HPC systems or accessed remotely by computers on Brown's campus network using the CIFS file access protocol.

# Globus

[Globus is a secure, reliable, research data management service](https://www.globus.org/data-transfer). With Globus, subscribers can move, share, and discover data via a single interface–whether your files live on a supercomputer, lab cluster, tape archive, public cloud or your laptop–you can manage this data from anywhere via just a web browser and using your existing identities. Transfers are facilitated through endpoints. Endpoints are data locations pointing to subscribers' specific datasets like a researcher's personal Google drive, research share or a folder on a computer.

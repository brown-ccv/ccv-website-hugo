# Globus

Globus is a secure, reliable research data management service. With Globus, subscribers can move, share, & discover data via a single interface – whether your files live on a supercomputer, lab cluster, tape archive, public cloud or your laptop, you can manage this data from anywhere via just a web browser and using your existing identities. Transfers are facilitated through endpoints. Endpoints are like collections pointing to subscribers specific datasets like his/her Google drive, research share or a folder on a computer.

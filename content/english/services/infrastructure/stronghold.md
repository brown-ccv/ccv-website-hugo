Stronghold is currently self-certified to meet the security requirements and controls for HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and is undergoing the certification process for FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act) and CJIS (Criminal Justice Information Security).

This service is customized to the needs of individual users and their data use agreements. Each Principal Investigator (PI) is given a dedicated environment for their project to support their researchers, graduate students, and collaborators. Access to the internet is restricted except for required locations for data imports or necessary software downloads. Import and export controls are in place to limit who can perform data migration, where sensitive data can come from and where desensitized or anonymized data can be moved to. Sensitive data is subject to file system auditing, and real-time alerting is available at the request of the PI. Please [contact us](mailto:CIS-Stronghold@brown.edu) for a consultation if you have a planned or current research project involving sensitive data that is made available to you through a data use agreement.

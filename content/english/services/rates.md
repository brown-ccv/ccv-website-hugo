# High Performance Computing Cluster (Oscar)
> The number and size of jobs allowed on Oscar vary with both partition and type of user account. The following partitions are available to all Oscar users:
* Batch   - General Purpose Computing
* GPU     - GPU Nodes
* BigMem  - Large Memory Nodes

{{< rates >}}

 * Each account is assigned 20G Home, 512G Scratch (purged every 30 days). 
 * All Priority accounts get a data directory. 
 * Priority accounts have a higher Quality-of-Service (QOS) i.e. priority accounts will have faster job start times.
 * The maximum number of cores and duration may change based on cluster utilization. For example - HPC Priority account has a Quality-of-Service (QOS) allowing up to 208 cores, 1TB memory, and a total per-job limit of 998,400 core-minutes. This allows a 208-core job to run for 80 hours, a 104-core job to run for 160 hours, or 208 1-core jobs to run for 80 hours.
  * GPU Definitions: 
    *  Std - QuadroRTX or lower
    *  High End - Tesla V100

> † Free exploratory accounts are available to all faculty and PIs at Brown. Priority accounts have a higher Quality-of-Service (QOS) i.e. priority accounts will have faster job start times.

> ‡The maximum number of cores and duration may change based on cluster utilization. Priority accounts each have a Quality-of-Service (QOS) allowing up to 208 cores, 1TB memory, and a total per-job limit of 998,400 core-minutes. This allows a 208-core job to run for 80 hours, a 104-core job to run for 160 hours, or 208 1-core jobs to run for 80 hours.

# Research Data Storage

* 1TB per Brown Faculty Member - Free
* 10TB per awarded Grant at the request of the Brown PI - a unique, active billing will be required to provide this allocation and the data will be migrated to archive storage at the end of the grant.
* Additional Storage Allocation - Year to Year - $100 / Terabyte / year

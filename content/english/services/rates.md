# High-performance Computing (Oscar)

{{< rates >}}


> Each account is assigned 20G Home, 512G Scratch (purged every 30 days), and 256G Data Directory (shared amongst members of the group) by default. Except for no-PI exploratory accounts, they do not get a Data directory.

> † Free exploratory accounts are available to all faculty and PIs at Brown. Priority accounts have a higher Quality-of-Service (QOS) i.e. priority accounts will have faster job start times.

> ‡The maximum number of cores and duration may change based on cluster utilization. Priority accounts each have a Quality-of-Service (QOS) allowing up to 208 cores, 1TB memory, and a total per-job limit of 998,400 core-minutes. This allows a 208-core job to run for 80 hours, a 104-core job to run for 160 hours, or 208 1-core jobs to run for 80 hours.

# High-performance Computing (Oscar)

{{< rates >}}

> Storage Quotas for every account (except Individual Exploratory):
* 20G Home Directory
* 512G Scratch (files and directories older than 30 days are purged)
* 1TB Data Directory (shared amongst members of the group) by default.

> GPU Definition:
* Std. (Standard) - QuadroRTX or lower
* HighEnd - Tesla v100

> Exploratory accounts are available to all faculty and PIs at Brown at no cost. 
> Priority accounts have a higher Quality-of-Service (QOS) i.e. priority accounts will have faster job start times.

> The maximum number of cores and duration may change based on cluster utilization. For example - HPC Priority account has a Quality-of-Service (QOS) allowing up to 208 cores, 1TB memory, and a total per-job limit of 998,400 core-minutes. This allows a 208-core job to run for 80 hours, a 104-core job to run for 160 hours, or 208 1-core jobs to run for 80 hours.

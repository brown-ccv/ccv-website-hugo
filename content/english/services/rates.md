# High-performance Computing (Oscar)

{{% table c="striped" hover="false" w="100" head="dark" %}}

| Account(s) Type | CPU Cores and Walltime | Cost | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Exploratory (PI Sponsored) | 32 for 48 hours, 2 std GPUs for 48 hours* | Free* | Available to all members affiliated with Brown |
| Exploratory (No PI) | 32 for 48 Hours | Free | No Data Directory is assigned |
| HPC Priority |208 for 96 hours** | $200/user/quarter | For CPU intensive workloads |
| HPC Priority+ | 416 for 96 hours** | $400/user/quarter | For CPU intensive workloads |
| HPC GPU Priority Standard | 4 std GPU for 96 hours, Titan RTX or lower | $200/user/quarter | Basic GPU intensive workloads |
| HPC GPU Priority Standard+ | 8 std GPU for 96 hours, Titan RTX or lower | $400/user/quarter | For workloads that require multiple GPUs
| HPC GPU Priority High End | 4 high-end GPU for 96 hours, Tesla V100 | $400/user/quarter | For workloads that require High-end GPUs
| HPC Priority Large Memory | 32 cores for 96 hours with 760GB real memory or 2TB Virtual | $100/user/quarter | For very memory-intensive workloads
| Condo Rental | 256 Cores | $10,000/year | No wall-time limits |

> Each account is assigned 20GB of memory for their Home directory and 512GB Scratch memory. Files that have not been accessed within the last 60 days are purged. Each account type other than the No-PI Exploratory account receives
a 1TB Data Directory (shared among members of the group) by default. The No-PI
Exploratory account does not come with a data directory.

> \* Free exploratory accounts are available to all members affiliated with Brown. Priority accounts have a higher Quality-of-Service (QOS) i.e. jobs on priority accounts are
given precedence over non-priority accounts

> \**The maximum number of cores and duration may change based on cluster utilization. Priority accounts each have a Quality-of-Service (QOS) allowing up to 208 cores, 1TB memory, and a total per-job limit of 998,400 core-minutes. This allows a 208-core job to run for 80 hours, a 104-core job to run for 160 hours, or 208 1-core jobs to run for 80 hours.

# Staff Services
| Support Level | Description | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| General Support | Limited code troubleshooting, training, office-hours. Limited to 1 week per year | $0
| Advanced Support | Any staff services requiring more than 1 week's effort per year | $85/hour |
| Project Collaboration | Percent time of a specific staff member charged directly to the grant | %FTE |

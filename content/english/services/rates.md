> † Free exploratory accounts are available to all tenure-track faculty and PIs at Brown. Students and researchers may also obtain an exploratory account with written permission from their advisor or PI. Exploratory accounts have a 32-core limit per user, with a per-job limit of 92,160 core-minutes.

> ‡The maximum number of cores and duration may change based on cluster utilization. Priority accounts each have a Quality-of-Service (QOS) allowing up to 208 cores, 1TB memory, and total per-job limit of 998,400 core-minutes. This allows a 208-core job to run for 80 hours, a 104-core job to run for 160 hours, or 208 1-core jobs to run for 80 hours.

# Research Data Storage

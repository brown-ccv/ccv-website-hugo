lead: "CCV's state of the art virtual reality theater displays over 100 million stereo pixels and consists of 69 full HD projectors driven by 20 nodes of the CCV HPC cluster. The projectors display onto 145 mirrors covering a 360 degree surface including overhead and underfoot. At normal viewing distances, the pixels are smaller than are resolvable by the human retina. The screen consists of translucent polycarbonate. The front wall is 25 feet long and 8 feet high and spans 180 degrees of view. The screens are suspended, along with half of the projectors, from an aluminum superstructure, with a catwalk for maintenance."

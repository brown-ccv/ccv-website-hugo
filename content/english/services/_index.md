  lead: 'CCV provides computing infrastructure, consulting, and support to the Brown
    Community. We have HPC specialists, data scientists, and software engineers available
    to help with the hardware we provide, as well as the software needs for classrooms,
    labs, and centers at Brown. We frequently partner with researchers on projects
    that may span weeks, months, or years. These partnerships can in some cases involve
    a researcher using grant funds to support one of our data scientists or research
    software engineers. '

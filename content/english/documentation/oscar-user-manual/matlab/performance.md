# Improving Performance & Memory Management

Matlab programs often suffer from poor performance and running out of
memory. Among other things, you can refer the following web pages for
best practices for an efficient code:

-   [Techniques to Improve
    Performance](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/techniques-for-improving-performance.html)
-   [Strategies for Efficient Use of
    Memory](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/strategies-for-efficient-use-of-memory.html)

The first step to speeding up Matlab applications is identifying the
part which takes up most of the run time. Matlab's "Profiling" tool can
be very helpful in doing that:

    Performance](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/profiling-for-improving-performance.html)

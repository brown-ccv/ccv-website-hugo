# Filing a support ticket

Filing a good support ticket makes it much easier for CCV staff to deal with
your request

When you email `support@ccv.brown.edu` aim to include the following:

* State the problem/request in the subject of the email
* Describe which software and with version you are using
* Error message (if there was one)
* The job number
* How you were running, e.g.  batch, interactively, vnc
* Give as as small an example as possible that reproduces the problem

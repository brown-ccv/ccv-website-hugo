# Adding Shared Files to Your Google Drive

In order to work with and save the notebooks shared with you via Google Drive, you must first make a copy of the documents shared with you into your [My Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive) section so that you have edit and save permissions. For Phys70 users, the following instructions will help you move the shared "PHYS0070\_Python\_basics" notebook  into your personal drive so that you can run and modify it on JupyterHub.

1. Navigate to the shared file/folder on your Google Drive by going to the link below: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15ztZjxdZ\_eZC\_RV5tEVmizNfNP8Km7oh](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15ztZjxdZ_eZC_RV5tEVmizNfNP8Km7oh)
2. Right click the file/folder you wish to copy. In this example, right click the "PHYS0070\_Python\_basics" file
3. Select "Make a Copy" from the drop-down menu
4. A popup will appear notifying that you have created a copy of the file.

A new copy of the file/folder will appear into your [My Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive) section of your Google Drive. In order to open this notebook, follow the instructions listed above [Opening an Existing Notebook You Own](launch-an-existing-notebook.md#opening-an-existing-notebook-you-own-from-google-drive)

# Adding Files From Your Desktop

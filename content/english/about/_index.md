mission:
  lead: 'The Center for Computation and Visualization provides high-performance computing
    and visualization services to the Brown community. We also collaborate with researchers

  text: We envision an environment where computational best practices, innovative
    solutions, and expert knowledge combine to build advanced tools for research and
    scholarship, and enable new discoveries and empowering collaborations. Our mission
    is to provide the scientific and technical computing expertise required to advance
    computational research and support Brownâ€™s academic mission. In practice, this
    frequently means partnering with researchers for projects that may span weeks,
    months, or years. In some cases, these partnerships can involve researchers using
    grant funds as partial support of one or our research software engineers or data
    scientists.

mission:
  lead: 'The Center for Computation and Visualization provides high-performance computing
    and visualization services to the Brown community. We also collaborate with researchers
    on projects across vast range of disciplines. '
  text: '<p>We envision an environment where computational best practices, innovative
    solutions, and expert knowledge combine to build advanced tools for research and
    to enable new discoveries. Our mission is to provide the scientific and technical
    computing expertise required to advance computational research and support Brownâ€™s
    academic mission. In practice, this frequently means partnering with researchers
    for projects that may span weeks, months, or years. In some cases, these partnerships
    can involve researchers using grant funds as partial support of one of our research
    software engineers or data scientists. We have a team of data scientists and research
    software engineers with a huge variety of scientific backgrounds (e.g., Engineering,
    Physics, Computer Vision, Biology, Psychology, Statistics, Applied Math, Computer
    Science, etc.), so we can closely calibrate a person with a project.</p>'
  diversity: '<p>CCV embraces a community enriched and enhanced by diverse dimensions, including race, ethnicity and national origins, disability status, gender and gender identity, sexuality, class and religion.  We believe diversity brings innovation and progress. We are especially committed to increasing the representation of those populations that have been historically underrepresented in STEM.</p>
      <p>We are committed to attracting, recruiting and retaining a diverse team. We especially encourage individuals from underrepresented groups to join our community.</p>'
people:
  lead: CCV team is awesome!

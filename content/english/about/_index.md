mission:
  lead: 'The Center for Computation and Visualization provides high-performance computing
    and visualization services to the Brown community. We also collaborate with researchers
    on projects across vast range of disciplines. '
  text: '<p>We envision an environment where computational best practices, innovative
    solutions, and expert knowledge combine to build advanced tools for research and
    to enable new discoveries. Our mission is to provide the scientific and technical
    computing expertise required to advance computational research and support Brown’s
    academic mission. In practice, this frequently means partnering with researchers
    for projects that may span weeks, months, or years. In some cases, these partnerships
    can involve researchers using grant funds as partial support of one of our research
    software engineers or data scientists. We have a team of data scientists and research
    software engineers with a huge variety of scientific backgrounds (e.g., Engineering,
    Physics, Computer Vision, Biology, Psychology, Statistics, Applied Math, Computer
    Science, etc.), so we can closely calibrate a person with a project.</p>'
  diversity: '<p>CCV embraces a community enriched and enhanced by diverse dimensions, including race, ethnicity and national origins, disability status, gender and gender identity, sexuality, class and religion.  We believe diversity brings innovation and progress. We are especially committed to increasing the representation of those populations that have been historically underrepresented in STEM.</p>
      <p>We are committed to attracting, recruiting and retaining a diverse team. We especially encourage individuals from underrepresented groups to join our community.</p>'

  lead: CCV team is awesome!

  subtitle1: 'Acknowledgment'
  acknowledgment: '<p class="text-dark">If you publish research that benefited from the use of CCV services or resources, we would greatly appreciate an acknowledgment that states:</p><p>This research [Part of this research] was conducted using [computational/visualization] resources and services at the Center for Computation and Visualization, Brown University.</p>'
  subtitle2: 'Facilities Statement'
  facilities: '<p class="text-dark">If you are writing a grant proposal for research that will use CCV facilities, please use the following text as a short description of our facilities:</p><p>Brown University continues to make significant investments in resources to promote high performance computing, analysis, and handling of massive data sets. A key resource is the Center for Computation and Visualization (CCV). CCV functions are to partner with faculty and researchers in their funded research projects with CCV application scientists, who write, test, and optimize code, and are co-authors on scientific publications; to generate, store, backup, analyze or visualize large datasets; and to provide the necessary infrastructure, including support, to transfer and share data at high bandwidths through a parallel file system. CCV establishes collaborations with research groups to install, run, test, and debug parallel or compute-intensive algorithms and applications and provides access to systems with specialized hardware, such as large memory or GPU accelerators. CCV also provides a business model to integrate and operate externally funded hardware into Brown’s on-campus data center.</p><p>The computing platform comprises ~500 high performance computing node system, some with 768GB and 2TB memory, as well as GPU nodes with roughly 200 GPUs (mostly Turing, with some Volta and Pascal GPUs), for a total core count of over 10,000. A GPFS parallel filesystem provides roughly 2PB of disk storage including  a 220TB NVMe disk pool. 100 Gb/s EDR Infiniband connectivity is used for all parallel applications messaging and I/O. The storage system is integrated with a 12PB Tivoli TSM backup/archival system. </p><p>CCV also maintains a high end visualization lab with large scale immersive visualization capabilities. This includes a fully immersive 360 degree YURT designed and built by Brown, a 3-wall Cave system, and a multi-projector stereo flat display wall. Custom visualization solutions for software and hardware needs are available.</p><p class="text-dark">Please contact us if you need a more detailed description.</p>'

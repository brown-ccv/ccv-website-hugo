  title: 'Facilities Statement'
  text: '<p class="text-dark">If you are writing a grant proposal for research that will use CCV facilities, please use the following text as a short description of our facilities:</p><p>CCV provides high-performance computing (HPC) resources and scientific computing expertise to Brown University’s research community. Oscar, CCV’s primary research computing cluster, consists 2 login nodes and 550 diskless multi-core nodes sharing a high-performance interconnect and file system and running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3. Oscar features 550 compute nodes (13348 CPU cores in total), with available memory ranging from 63 GB to 756 GB per node. Oscar also includes 26 GPU nodes with a total of 170 GPUs and available memory ranging from 11 to 32 GB VRAM per GPU. Oscar’s nodes are provisioned by xCAT (IBM’s cluster administration toolkit), and are clients of a GPFS parallel filesystem which provides a total of 1.7 PB of usable storage space. All nodes have 100 Gb/s EDR Infiniband connectivity.</p><p>CCV’s state-of-the-art infrastructure is maintained and operated by CCV staff, who have extensive experience in operating shared computational clusters. CCV staff members are responsible for scheduled maintenance, access control, and integration with research-specific hardware as required by researchers. A large collection of software is available on Oscar, including: R, Matlab, Mathematica, Maple, and a large range of optimized math and science libraries and domain-specific applications. CCV staff members are available to assist with the acquisition and installation of any applications not already available on Oscar. CCV staff members are also available to consult on research projects and work directly to support and develop the advanced computational methods used by researchers at Brown.</p><p class="text-dark">Please contact us if you need a more detailed description.</p>'

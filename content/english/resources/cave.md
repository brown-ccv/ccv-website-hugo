lead: "CCV's original fully immersive display system is a Tan `vr-Cube`, which we call the Cave (CAVE is an acronym for 'Cave Automatic Virtual Environment' which is now trademarked by FakeSpace Systems, Inc.).
The Cave is an 8' cube with projected images on the front, left and right walls, as well as the floor. CrystalEyes LCD-shutter glasses provide stereo depth-perception, and a variety of Intersense and Polhemus tracking devices allow software to track the position of a user's hand, head, wand, etc. The Cave also has a multi-speaker sound system that provides positional audio."

## Second Content Reviewer Checklist

New Features and some other niche PR's require a second content reviewer.  This reviewer should not have been close to the design/development of the change so that they can look at the PR with the critical lens of an outsider.  Given this, especially focus on how this feature fits in with the website and does it make sense to someone without context/outside of CCV.

Make sure the updates are consistent with the CCV website as a whole, the content is in the right place, and is easily understandable/accessible.  Some of the things you should check:

- [ ] Check spelling
- [ ] Will this make sense to an outsider?
- [ ] Is this information redundant with other places in the website?
- [ ] Do any links work and go to the expected place?
- [ ] Does this look how you would expect?
